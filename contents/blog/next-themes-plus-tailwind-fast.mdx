When we talk about web design trends last year, dark mode is one thing that shouldn't be left behind to discuss. Searches for <i>dark mode</i> on Google have started to show an increase since 2019. This is because many companies or industries in technology such as Google, Facebook, Instagram and Apple have started implementing designs with dark themes.

## Introduction

This article will explain how to implement dark mode using TailwindCSS on the NextJS site. Before we continue, there are things that must be understood first. That is the basics of TailwindCSS and NextJS. No need for advanced things.

In this experiment you will use :

- <b>Next.JS</b>: The React Meta framework
- <b>TailwindCSS</b>: A utility-first CSS framework
- <b>next-themes</b>: An abstraction for themes in your Next.js app.

## Getting Started

If you don't have a Next.js + TailwindCSS site to work from, You can follow this and open documentation about instalation TailwindCSS and Next.JS.

After this point we need to update some configuration files.

### Create Next App & Install Tailwind

First of all we need to create Next.JS app. To create new Next.JS app you can use `create-next-app`, and it will setup everything automatically for you. You can run `npx create-next-app@latest`.

```ts
// pages/_app.js

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

### Tailwind.config.js

After installing TailwindCSS, you can find the `tailwind.config.js` inside root directory. This config is almost as basic as it can be. The config has a `content` property that used to check and configure paths to all of your HTML templates, JavaScript components, and any other source files that contain Tailwind class names.
